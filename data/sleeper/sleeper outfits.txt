	description `The Apoapsis-Class Turret taps into the natural hyperspace fluctuations that exists between the turret and target vessel. Since these fluctuation travel through space faster than light, from the perspective of both the target and turret, the beam propagates backwards in time and originates from inside the target vessel, connecting with the turret at the moment of firing. In this way, it circumvents the target's shield matrix.`
	description `The Sleeper's willingness to play fast and loose with such causal paradoxes greatly concerns the Quarg while simultaneously amusing the Pug.`

	description "A unique characteristic of most Sleeper outfits is their efficient utilization of naturally occurring energy gradients to derive their power. As such, they produce as much high-quality waste heat is as needed to keep them running. By using their coveted Lissajous-Class Thermal Regenerator to convert this waste heat into energy at -by human standards- perfect efficiency, the Sleepers require no conventional power generators."

	description "This defence system injects, then ignites a small amount of hyperspace fuel within the shield matrix of a Sleeper ship just prior to an enemy attack. The resultant plasma acts as an active shield that is opaque to both projectile, and energy weapons."
