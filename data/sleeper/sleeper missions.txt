			`As you walk through the main lobby of the space port, you are knocked to the ground by what feels like a large person sidelong into you. As you get to your feet, you look up expecting to see a strong barrel-chested man, but instead see a small, young woman in a lab coat. She is bent down, picking up some data drives that were scattered in the collision. As she puts the last drive into a cradled arm, she begins to apologize to you until she makes eye contact with you.`
			`	"Captain <last>?" she says. "THE Captain <first> <last>?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, I'm Captain <last>."`

					goto "decline"
			`	"I knew it!" she exclaims. "Listen, I'm one of the scientists who is studying the graviton beam devices left over by the Pug Protectorate here on <planet> after you helped defeat them. I've just come across some interesting results and you would be the perfect person to give me a hand."`
			`	You tell her that you are interested in helping, and without skipping a beat she continues to explain the situation.`
			`	"I've been using the network of graviton emitters and reflectors to form a very long baseline interferometer," she says. "This interferometer can be used to detect extremely faint sources of gravitational waves, and thus map out the distribution of matter in distant parts of the galaxy."`
			choice
				`	"Did you find anything interesting?"`
				`	"Ok, but what does this have to do with me?"`
			`	"Well," she says, "I've discovered a previously unknown cluster of stars far to the Northeast of human space. Given your reputation for adventure, you would be the perfect person to confirm my findings. But that's not even the most interesting part."`
			choice

					goto "second thing"
				`	"Wait, I've been east of human space. There are a race of aliens and their robotic warships called the Korath that live in a cluster around that area. Is this the cluster you found?"`
			`	She leans towards you and lowers her voice conspiratorially, "The fact that I work with alien technology means that I'm allowed access to all of the Republic's classified first contact documents. The area I've discovered is to the east of even the Korath and their automata. I can assure you that no human has ever explored this region."`
			choice
				`	"What can you tell me about this region of space?"`
			`	"Well," she explains, "the peculiar thing is that I've found an anomalous gravitational signal coming from a stellar mass black hole in a corner of the cluster. The signal suggests that there is a large object just above the innermost stable circular orbit of this black hole." She shifts the data drives uncomfortably in her arms, "It's very unlikely an astronomical body could form there naturally. It's probably an error with my measurement technique, so if you could bring me back the sensor logs of that system in particular, I'd be able to re-calibrate my interferometer."`
			`	You let her know you'll check out the system and the scientist gives you the address of her lab for when you return.`

Cobwebs cover all the desks. As you try to find some clues as to where the scientist may have gone, you come across a single piece of equipment. It is a long slender cylinder with a switch on the side. It fits comfortably in you palm.`
			`	You flip the switch and feel your skin tingle with static electricity. You take a look down at your hands and instead of seeing your palms, you see a set of unfamiliar ones. You rush over to a cracked and grimy mirror in the corner of the room. In the reflection you see the scientist looking back at you, mirroring your every move. When you switch off the device the face of the scientist fades, only to be replaced by your own. A hologram.`

			`While the other stations within this section of space were unwilling to let you land, as soon as the trajectory of your ship made it clear that you were approaching this station, some of the small alien vessels in the system congregate around your ship and corral it towards what is clearly a single large docking assembly on the side of the station. As you make contact with the docking assembly the small vessels take off and without warning your ship powers down. At first you fear that this might be an indication that the aliens in the system may try to forcefully board your ship, but the station on the other end of your docking port remains eerily quiet.`
			`	Do you want to proceed through your docking port and explore the station?`
			choice
				`	(Yes.)`
				`	(No! Perform a manual engine restart and get out of here!)`
					flee
			`	You approach the airlock of your ship, but before you can flip the open/close toggle, the airlock opens itself. Clearly whoever is operating this station has managed to remotely hack your shipboard computer. You exit your ship and cautiously walk into the docking assembly. Given the large size of the station, you were expecting to find a large habitable section within, filled with a congregation of whatever species lives in this space. Instead, you are surprised to find that the habitable section of this station has little more area than an early human refuelling depot, and consists of just a single room. Just as you were beginning to think the station is totally empty, a tentacle emerges from a recess in the wall adjacent to the airlock you just entered from. The tentacle is followed by five others and a squat round body. The creature's exterior looks to be made out of brushed metal, and you guess it is some sort of robot. The machine approaches you slowly, but with no lack of coordination; the whole time a single lens fixed on you.`
			choice
				`	"Hello?"`
				`	"Ahh!" (Run back to your ship and perform a manual engine restart before that thing kills you!)`
					flee
			`	At the sound of your voice the machine stops approaching you. It straightens on it's tentacles slightly, and while still keeping it's lens focused on you, it begins emitting noise that sounds rather like water dripping into a pail.`
			choice
				`	(Try to imitate the sound.)`
				`	"I don't know what that means."`
				`	"I actually am quite thirsty. A refreshment would be lovely now that you mention it."`
			`	The machine pauses for several seconds after your response, as if trying to decide how to respond. Instead of making more dripping noises it begins emitting short and abrupt chirping noises. They are quite annoying.`
			choice
				`	"This isn't going anywhere. I'll come back with somebody that can translate."`
					goto "giveup"
				`	(Try your best to say a few words in the Hai language.)`
			`	The robot clearly doesn't recognize Hai, and seems to give up. Instead of trying to continue to communicate it turns around and begins walking away on it's strange metal tentacles. As it turns the corner of the same recess it came from, you hear the familiar whir of your ship entering it's startup sequence. You suppose you'll have to return here when you've found an effective way of communicating with the robot.`

				`	(Not right now.)`
					defer
			`	When you track down Rek, she greats you warmly and is eager to tell you of the progress the Wanderers have made in rebuilding the planets they are on. You interrupt her to explain you've come for some advice on translation, and tell her of the encounter with with alien robot to the east.`
			`"This is a vexing situation", she says. "From you description the machine may posses a degree of sentience meaning communication is possible. Normally, I would be interested in assisting you in translation, however my responsibilities here preclude my involvement." She looks very disappointed that she cannot travel to meet the robot.`
			choice
				`	"Do you have any advice?"`
				`	"Are there any other ways I could communicate with it?"`
			`	Rek thinks for a moment and then proceeds, "Yes, there may be another path. If the machine is capable of independent reasoning it may be able to interpret certain natural constants as the basis for an intermediate language. If you provide a logical map between this intermediate language and your species', the machine should be able to learn your language."`
			choice
				`	"What would the language based on natural constants look like?"`
			`	 "This is not for me to decide," she says while giving her feathers a proud ruffle. "Synthetic languages require a lack of... soul to be understood universally. It is nearly impossible for organic beings to create one without imparting their direction into it." Rek is clearly enjoying your questions, and being able to explain the intricacies of her work.`
			choice
				`	"There is still the issue of the map between the languages."`
				`	"I'm a bit lost here, but didn't you say I'd need some sort of map?"`
			`	Rek looks at you quizzically and points to the translator you've been using for the conversation with her, "Did you not require a copy of the cultural archive of your species to bargain for this device? Certainly, the entirety of human history should provide sufficient context for this map."`
			choice
				`	"Ok, so I have everything I need, but you can't expect me to create this language on my own!"`
				`	"No need to be condescending."`
			`	Rek let's out the Wanderer version of a laugh; a rapid series of clicks with her beak, "I'm sorry <first>. You need not do this in isolation. If you bring our new allies, the Mereti, your copy of the human archive, I believe they will be able to create everything this robot needs to understand your language."`

				`	"Robot! I demand your assistance!"`

You explain that you are here on the suggestion of Ektasi Rek to obtain a synthetic language that can act as a bridge between your language and the language used by another machine intelligence.`

After a brief pause the machine says, "This data is sufficient to [complete, accomplish] the task you request. This will take some time." You begin to start out to explore the greenhouse while you wait, but before you can get more than ten paces away, the drone calls out, "The translational tool is ready."`
